-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When i initialize a repository it has created a new directory called .git in the directory of the repository. 
I need to do it because i can track changes in repository's files.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from working directory and repository because it's a temporany area where put files
that you want to commit in the repository. It offers an area for prevents damages or changes on the original files 
that can't impossibile repair and return a previous version of files.

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I use staging area adding files that i do changes, with the command get diff --staged can i see changes between the
most recent commit and staging area and so i control if the commit that i want to do contains a one logical change 
per commit if not i return back to the old commit.
