-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when i want to share with other people or colleagues and collaborate with them.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I have more control of what changes push on the remote repository.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy to a remote repository from another user that it can't permitted to change, 
a clone is a copy of a repository in local, branch is a way for have different part of a project and different changes.
I use fork to collaborate to another user in a project. I use clone when i want to save locally in hard drive a copy 
to the repository and i use branch when i want to test or do experiment something.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote repository is that I can work on this
offline.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I using chat and forums to collaborate with others developers. It's easier to discuss and talk with others
developers but it's harder to work togheter wiht same project because each developer write his part of code
and it's difficult find changes and organize activities with them.
