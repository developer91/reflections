-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when i want to share with other people or colleagues and collaborate with them.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I have more control of what changes push on the remote repository.
