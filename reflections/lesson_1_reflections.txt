-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Using diff between two versions of a file help me see the bug because I see where there are differences and lines of codes
where in a file there aren't and other there are.

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I am a more efficiente programmer in the long term because I see history of periodic changes of the file and then I can
monitoring what code I have write in the time and see errors quickly in the program.

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I think that pros are: control of what changes I have done, control of descrition and helpful information of changes made, plus more one change in multiple files
for one logical operation instead cons are: much work to do with manually changes in one logical operation, less efficient to do
 
-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in one commit I can do changes that is one logical operation in multiple files and for this Git allows to allocate in one commit
that files.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use these commands to view the history of files reading each commit for a file
 that describes changes done in that file e I can see differences between two version of file using the command git diff.

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It might more confident to make changes that could break something because with the command git checkout it's possible
to return a earlier version of file before changes is made.

-Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I try Git for coding of course!
